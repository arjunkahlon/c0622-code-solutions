After installing our packages, we create an .env file to be used by the application


Database Setup
This application is built using a PostgreSQL relational database.  We must first
  setup the database.

1.	We begin by starting the postgresql server utilizing the “sudo service
  postgresql start” command
2.	We then create a new relational database named reactContext utilizing the
  “createdb reactContext” command.
3.	Next, we reference our schema.sql file for the logical configuration of our
  database. A schema design allows us to organize the data into separate entities
  and can be reused with other databases. In our schema.sql, we have the
  PostgreSQL command: `create schema “public”` which defines and enters a new
  schema named “public” into the current database. This schema name must be
  unique from any existing schema names in the current database. Next we create
  a table named users in the specified schema (“public”). In the arguments, we
  create the column names: userId, username, hashedPassword, and createdAt. The
  createdAt is generated with a timestamp and the userId is Auto-Incremented
  using Serial. The primary key of the schema is userId. We also utilize a unique
  constraint to ensure that each username is unique.
4.	Next, let’s reference data.sql. This file contains the SQL command for
  inserting into the username and hasedPassword columns of the users table. The
  file inserts the username “anonymous” accompanies by a hashed password.
5.	We then run the import shell script to initialize our current database
  utilizing the schema provided in schema.sql and the initial data provided in
  data.sql with the DATABASE_URL provided in our .env file.
6.	Finally, we run the command “pgweb –db=reactContext” to start our web-based
  pgweb database browser for the database: reactContext.

Server Setup
To start the server, we run index.js. This file is only ran once, and any
  necessary callbacks are added to the Callback Queue.

  Let’s examine the modules we import into our index.js file.
1.	We import the path module for working with directories/file systems
2.	We import the PostgreSQL client (pg) to connect to our database
3.	We import argon2 for hashing and verifying user inputted passwords
4.	We import express as we will be creating an express application
5.	We import jwt to digitally sign tokens sent in the resposne
6.	We import the ClientError module which handles constructing the error
  message object with the status and error message.
7.	We import the error-middleware module which handles the type of error being
  encountered. If it’s a case of ClientError, we send the client a res with the
  error status and error message. If the error is a JsonWebTokenError (imported
  from ‘jsonwebtoken’) we send the client a response with a 401 error and
  ‘invalid access token’ error. Otherwise, the error is a server side error,
  thus we send the client a 500 error code with the message ‘an unexpected
  error has occurred.’

We then create a new PostgreSQL Connection pool and assign it to the const
  variable db. The constructor for this object has two properties:
1.	connectionString: Database URL provided by the .env file
2.	SSL property with it’s rejectUnauthorized property set to false

We then instantiate an Express application by calling express() and assigning
  the return to the const variable app.

We then add the middlewares for serving static files and JSON request parsing,
  express.static() and express.json() respectively.

The server handles two post requests routes:

  /api/auth/sign-up’

  1.	User sends post request to application at url: ‘/api/auth/sign-up’
  2.	The username and password properties are destructured from the request
        body and their values are stored in the const variables, username and
        password, respectively.
  3.	If either the username or password are missing from the request body, the
        server throws a 400 error to the client alerting them that both fields
        are required.
  4.	If both the username and password are included, the application uses the
        hash method of the argon2 object to create a hashed password. After the
        hashed password is created, the application creates a sql command to
        insert into the username and hashedpassword into the users table.
  5.	If this user insertion is successful, the server sends a 201 status with
        a JSON object of the user data.
  6.	If any of the promises fail, the error is send to the error middleware.

  '/api/auth/sign-in'

  1.	User sends a post request to the url: /api/auth/sign-in’
  2.	The username and password properties are destructured from the request
        body and their values are stored in the const variables, username and
        password
  3.	If either the username or password are missing from the request body, the
        server throws a 401 error to the client alerting them that the login
        is invalid.
  4.	If both the username and password are included in the request body, the
        server creates a SQL command to retrieve the userID and hashedPassword
        from the users table of the database where the unique username in the
        database matches the username of the request body.
  5.	The database is queries and the first element of the rows property of the
        result object is stored in the const variable users. If no user is
        returned from the query, the server throws a 401 error, alerting the
        client that the login is invalid.
  6.	If a user is successfully retrieved from the database, the server
        destructures the userId and hashedPassword properties of this user
        object and stores their values in the const variables userId and
        hashedPassword, respectively.
  7.	The server then uses the verify method of the argon2 object to compare
        the retrieved hashPassword with the password obtained from the request
        body. If a match is not found, the application throws a 401 error that
        the login is invalid.
  8.	If a match is found, the server creates a new object named payload with
        two properties: userId and username.
  9.	The server then utilizes the sign method of the jwt object to create a
        digital token signed by our server. In the arguments for the sign method
        are our the payload object and  a secret key stored “secretly” on our
        server .env file.
  10.	The server then sends a response back to the client in the form of a JSON
        object with the token and payload.
  11.	Any errors are sent to the error middleware described above.

Applicaiton Flow

  1. The user requests http:localhost:3000. The browser sends an HTTP Get
      Request to our server at Host: localhost:3000. The static middleware
      automatically looks for index.html and sends it the client.
  2. The browser parses the HTML file and sends additional requests for
        linked stylesheets and referenced js files. In this application, the
        browser makes requests for the linked Bootstrap and Font Awesome
        stylesheets. The browser also requests main.js which is linked in the
        script tag.
  3. Main.js contains all of our bundled JavaScript modules through webpack. The
        entry point of these modules is index.jsx.
  4. Index.jsx queries the DOM of our index.html for the div element with id
        attribute "root". It then passes in this div element as an argument
        for the ReactDOM.createRoot() method which creates a container and returns
        it the const variable root. These container will be used for rendering
        React elements.
  5. The render method of the root object is then called with the argument: the
        React element App with no props passed in.
  6. The App component call its constructor method, which first calls the
      super function (the constructor for the React.Component). We call super()
      first as our component extends from React.Component. Next, we initialize
      state by setting our properties to their initial values. The property: user
      is set to null. The property: isAuthorizing is set to false. The route
      property is initialzed by calling parseRoute with the hash property of the
      location property of the window object passed in as an argument. We complete
      our constructor by binding our methods to this.
  7. The App component renders it's initial state. Since isAuthorizing is true,
      the render method immediately returns null and exits. Then, the componentDidMount
      method is called. The componet creates an event listener on the window
      object that adds a callback for a change in the fragment identifier in the URL. If,
      this fragment does change, the component calls setState and updates route
      by calling parseRoute on window.location.hash. This is how we will be
      swapping between pages in our application.
  8. The App component then gets the jwt from the user's local storage and
      assigns it to the const variable token. It then checks to see if the
      token exists. If it does, it decodes the token and sets the return of the
      decode method to the const variable user. If the token does not exist,
      it sets the value of null to the const variable user.
  9. The App component then calls setState and updates the App component property
      user to the value we just obtained and updates isAuthorizing to false. The
      App component now renders again. Since, isAuthorizing is now false, we do
      not exit immediately as we did in our initial state.
  10. We destructure the state property of the this object and store the const
        varibales user and route. We also destructure the handleSignIn and
        handleSignOut methods of this this object into the const variables
        handleSignIn and handleSignOut. The four destructured const variables
        are placed into an object literal and assigned to the const variable
        contextValue.
  11. We pass our contextValue object as a value prop to the Provider component.
        This object will be passed onto to consuming components that are descendents of this
        provider.
  12. Inside the Provider React element, we have an fragment that will be used to
        seperate the navbar component with the view swappable page componenets.
        Inside the return expression for the PageContainer component, we have a
        JavaScript expression in which we call the renderPage method of the
        this object.
  13. Inside the renderPage method, we destructure the current state's route
        into the const variable path. We now have a condtional expression to
        determine which page to render. If the route is empty, we return the
        Home page. If the path is sign-in or sign-out, we render the
        Auth page. Otherwise, we render the Not Found page.


Now that I've described the backend flow and environment, as well as the
  initial application flow when the application is loaded, we can now discuss
  the application flow of the 4 user features:
1. User can sign up
2. User can sign in
3. User can stay signed in (even when they refresh the page)
4. User can sign out



User can sign up

* When the user boots up the web application, they are greeted with a sign in
    page. On the navbar, there is a button to take us to the Sign Up Page.
    Let's discuss how we got there.

1. As I explained earlier, the app attempts to get the jwt from the user's
    local storage. Currently, this token does not exist, so the user property
    of the App component is null. Since the initial route is null, the renderPage
    method of the App component returns the Home Page.

2. The Home Page now renders its initial state. It checks the context provided
    from App and determines that the user is null. Thus it is returns the
    Redirect component with a to prop which has a value of "sign-in".

3. The Redirect function is called. It creates a new URL object with the location
      property of the window object passed in as an argument. The function then
      checks the to property of the passed in props object. If to has a
      value of an empty string, the function sets the hash property to a single
      '#'. If to has any other value, the value becomes the fragment identifier.
      The function finally calls the replace method of the location property of
      the window object. This replaces the previous fragment identfier with the
      newly created on. In our case, the passed in "sign-in" prop becomes the
      new fragment identifier.

4. Now let's recall that the App component created an event listener on the
      window object that listens for a hashchange event. The redirect function
      changed the hash to "sign-in". This triggers the App component's setState
      method which updates it's route property to our new hash ("sign-in"). Now
      we enter the render() method. In our renderPage() method, the conditional
      (path === 'sign-in') evaluates to true, and thus, the App component renders
      the Auth page.

5. Now we render the Auth page. The Auth page destructures the context object
      provided through AppContext into const variables user, route, and handleSignIn.
      If a user exists, the auth page calls the Redirect function and passes
      in an empty string as a prop. This causes the App to render the Home page.
      However, if the user is null, the Auth component then checks the current route.

6. If the route is ‘sign-in’, the component prompts the user to sign in. Otherwise,
      the component prompts the user to create an account. For this feature, we
      are signing up. Thus we click the Sign Up button on the navbar. This takes us
      to the navbar component.

7. In the navbar component, we are provided with the context object which is
      destructured into the user and handleSignOut variables. The component
      checks if the user exists. If the user exists, the navbar renders a Sign
      Out button. If the user does not exist (is null), the component renders two
      buttons: Sign In and Sign Up. In our previous step, we clicked the Sign
      Up button on this navbar. This button is a React Element of type anchor with
      an href property with the value '#sign-up'. So when the user clicks this
      button, the hash changes to '#sign-up'. This triggers the hashchange event
      listener which causes the App to setState. The App component's route
      property is updated to reflect our new hash '#sign-up'. The App component
      renders and renderPage returns the Home component. The Home component is
      rendered but now with the hash "#sign-up". The Home component checks the
      route, and creates it's welcome message: "Create an account to get
      started!".

8. Having clicked the sign up button, the home component has now rendered with
      the "#sign-up" route and it's affiliated welcome message. What the user is
      presented with is a Sign Up form with inputs for the username and password. How
      is this form constructued and presented to the user? It is through the AuthForm
      Component which is returned within the render method of the Auth page. The props
      passed into this Auth Form are key prop which has a value of the path property
      of the route object, the action prop which also has a value of the path property
      of the route object, and the handleSignIn method of the App Component. All three
      of these props are provided through the context.

9. The Auth Form component constructs and sets it's properties, username and password,
      to an empty string. The component has two methods. The first is a handleChange
      method which handles an onChange event for user entry into the form fields.
      The second is a handleSubmit method which handles the form submission. Both
      methods are binded to the this object in the component constructor.

10. The component render method destructures the props property and stores the action
      property in the const variable: action. The component also destructures the
      handleChange and handleSubmit methods into the const variables handleChange and
      handleSubmit. The component then sets the alternate of the action variable into
      the const variable alternatActionText. It also uses the action to set the text
      content inside the Submit button (Register for Sign Up and Log In for Sign In).

11. As the user enters in their username and password, the authform component handles
      onChange event and calls setState to update the properties, password and
      username. When the user clicks the Register Button, the component handles the
      onSubmit event on the form and calls the handleSubmit method.

12. The handleSubmit method calls the preventDefault method of the event object to
      prevent the default refresh. The component then stores the const variable
      action "sign-up" from this.props. This variable will be used when handling our fetch request.
      The component then create a req object, giving the method property a value of
      'POST' and setting the appropriate headers. The compoenent this stringifies
      the username and password and stores this JSON data as the value of the body
      property of the req object.

13. The component then creates a fetch request to 'api/auth/(our const variable action)'
      with out req object as the second argument. In our sign up case, we are sending a
      post request to 'api/auth/sign-up' and attaching username: "hankhill" password: "propane1"
      from the body of the req object. Once our promise resolves, we call the json method of the
      response object to convert our response to JSON. We then create a new promise on the result
      of the res.json() method, in which we update window.location.hash to 'sign-in'.

      Now, let's refer back to our server. The steps our server takes are explained in detail above
      on line 99. Our server, processes this request, hashes the provided password, and stores
      this user into our users table. Thus our user has signed up.

11. The hash change to "sign-in" triggers the hashchange event callback on the App component. Thus,
      our app calls renderPage and renders the auth component but with the route 'sign-in'.

12. This completes our Feature 1. For the remaining features, I will be referencing back to
      the previous explanations in order to create a succinct explanation.



User can sign in

1. Having signed up, we are now transferred to the "sign-in" route in which we initially
    began on Feature 1. Please refer to steps 1-5 on Feature 1 in order to understand how
    we arrived at this page.

2. In this feature we are signing in. The database  has our account "hankhill"
    and it's hashedpassword stored. We can go ahead and enter in our log in
    credentials "hankhill" in the username field and "propane1" in the password
    field. The onChange event causes the AppForm component to setState on its
    properties with each character entered. This change can be seen in React
    Component developer tools. Once our credentials are entered. We click the
    Log-In button.

3. Clicking the Log In button triggers the onSubmit event which has a value of a
      JavaScript expression with the const varibale handleSubmit. Remember that this
      variable has a value of this.handleSubmit. Thus, we call the handleSubmit method
      of the AppForm component.

4. In the handleSubmit, we store the value "sign-in" in our action variable. We then
    create our req object with the 'POST' value for method and the appropriate headers.
    We stringify the username and password and set this string as the  value of the body
    property. We then make our fetch request to the server. This request is
    '/api/auth/sign-in username: "hankhill" password: "propane1'. For the detailed steps
    of our 'api/auth/sign-in' route, please refer to line 116. Our server received are
    request and creates a SQL command to grab a match for the provided username from Our
    database. If this user does not exist, our server throws an 'Invalid Login' error.
    If a user does exist, the server then verifies the provided password with the stored
    hashedPassword. If a match is found, the server sends a token back to the user in the
    response.

5. Our authform then performs the JSON method on the response from the server. After, it
    checks this result to ensure that a user and token exist. If they do exist. The authform
    calls the onSignIn method that was passed as a prop with the result as an argument. Now,
    let's refer back to AuthForm's parent, Auth. the onSignIn prop that was passed to AuthForm
    is a JavaScript expression containing the handleSignIn variable which has a value of
    the handleSignIn method provided by the context. Now let's refer back to the App component.

6. The handleSignIn method of the App component is called and a user and token are destructured
    from the result. The component then sets the token in the user's local storage with the name
    'react-context-jwt'. The component this setsState with the updated user.

7. The App component renders again. Now the route is still 'sign-in'. However, we return
    the Auth component in our render method. In the Auth component, the component verifies
    that the user exists and returns the Redirect component with a empty string as the prop.
    In the Redirect component, the component evalues the props.to to an empty string and thus
    updates the hash property of the url object to a '#'. This triggers the hashchange event
    and causes the App component to render once again but with the route '#'.

8. This brings us to the end of the feature. We are signed in and the current hash is '#'.
    Our App component thus calls it renderPage method and returns the Home component.  The
    Home comopnent verifies that the user exists, and thus returns the gifContainer.

    We are greeted with a variety of Rick Roll gifs. On the navbar, we have a Sign Out button.
    Refer to line 270 for why the nav bar button is 'Sign Out'. The NavBar component
    checks if the user exists. If the user exists, the navbar renders a Sign
    Out button. If the user does not exist (is null), the component renders two
    buttons: Sign In and Sign Up. In our case, we have signed in, the app has confirmed
    that we exist, and has rendered the Sign Out Button.


User Can Stay Signed In

When we leave the page and return or refresh the page, we are still signed in
  and do not have to go through the process of signing in. Why is that?

1. Recall from Step 8 of the Initial Application Flow (line 185).

The App component gets the jwt from the user's local storage and
  assigns it to the const variable token. It then checks to see if the
  token exists. If it does, it decodes the token and sets the return of the
  decode method to the const variable user. If the token does not exist,
  it sets the value of null to the const variable user.

  In our case, the token does exist in our local storage with the name 'react-context-jwt.
  Thus, the App component decodes our JWT and stores the user property. This user
  property is provided to all of the App component's children components through context.

2. With out user stored, the App calls its renderPage method. The page that is rendered
    is determined by the path property of the App component. Recall that this property is
    obtained from window.location.hash. Thus the browser provides our component with the
    route (in the case of browser refresh or clicking the back button). This
    view handling is why our Auth component has a condition that checks if the User
    exists and returns the Redirect component with an empty "" string if the user
    does exist. We would not want the user to revisit any form of Authentication if
    they are already logged in. Rather the App component calls renderPage which returns
    the Home component which verifies that the user exists and thus returns the gif container.

User Can Sign Out

As I mentioned above, the user is presented with a Sign Out button on the NavBar component.

1. When the user clicks this Sign Out button,, the onClick event fires which has a value
    of the JavaScript expression with the const variable handleSignOut. The const variable
    handleSignOut has a value of the handleSignOut method provided by context. This takes us
    back to the App Component.

2. The handleSignOut method of the App component is called and the App component removes
      the 'react-context-jwt' token from the user's local storage. The App component then
      calls setState and sets the user property to null. This causes the  component to render
      once again to an initial state where we land on the Sign-In page. This is due to the
      user being nul with no token in local storage. For a detailed explanation, please refer
      back to line 227.
